# Real-time Chat Application Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our Real-time Chat Application. This document provides an overview of our chat application, its purpose, features, and usage guidelines.

### Purpose

Our Real-time Chat Application aims to provide users with a seamless and secure platform for real-time messaging. Whether you want to chat one-on-one or in group chats, our application offers a feature-rich experience for communication.

### Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly.
- **User Authentication**: Securely manage your account with user registration and login.
- **Chat Rooms**: Create or join chat rooms for group conversations.
- **Message Storage**: Access chat history and retrieve previous messages.
- **Online Status**: See who's online and when they're active.
- **Attachments**: Share multimedia attachments like images and files.
- **Search**: Find specific messages within conversations.
- **User Blocking and Muting**: Manage unwanted messages and notifications.

## System Overview

Our Real-time Chat Application is built on a robust architecture that ensures real-time communication, data storage, and security.

### Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

- **Backend Server**: Handles user authentication, real-time messaging, and message storage.
- **Database**: Stores user data, chat history, and message content.
- **WebSocket**: Enables real-time communication between clients and the server.

### Technology Used

Our application leverages the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: Backend server environment.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **WebSocket (e.g., [socket.io](http://socket.io))**: Real-time communication.
- **mySQL (example)**: Database for data storage.
- **Passport.js**: User authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication tokens.

## Deployment and Automation

Our Real-time Chat Application utilizes Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS services, and shell scripts for deployment and automation.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

We employ Docker and GitHub Actions for our CI/CD pipeline:

- **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates the CI process, including linting, unit testing, building Docker images, and pushing them to a Docker registry.

- **CD Pipeline**: Upon successful CI, GitHub Actions triggers the CD workflow, deploying Docker images to AWS EC2 instances or ECS clusters.

### AWS Services Integration

We utilize various AWS services for scalability and reliability:

- **Amazon S3**: Stores static assets such as multimedia attachments and frontend assets.
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed database service for storing user data, chat history, and message content.
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides backend server environment for Node.js applications and WebSocket servers.
- **Autoscaling Group**: Dynamically adjusts EC2 instances based on traffic demand for optimal performance and resource utilization.

### Shell Scripts

Shell scripts automate deployment, backup, and maintenance tasks:

- **Deployment Automation**: Scripts handle Docker container orchestration, database migrations, and service restarts.
- **Backup and Maintenance**: Scripts automate backup processes for databases and S3 assets, and handle routine maintenance tasks like log rotation and server health checks.

## Testing

We prioritize the reliability and security of our application through thorough testing.

### Unit Testing

Our codebase is extensively tested using unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components.

### Integration Testing

We perform integration testing to validate the interactions between different parts of our application.

### Security Testing

Security is a top concern. We conduct security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Usage of the App
